On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin'
Out as one old song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through
