On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin'
Out as one old song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through
So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Yeah most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old cliches:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page
